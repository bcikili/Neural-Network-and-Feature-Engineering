# Neural-Network-and-Feature-Engineering

Using Kaggle Kickstarter data (Almost 1 million rows) I clean, combine, wrangle, convert and dummy code it. 
I apply statistical methods to for hypothesis testing. 
Then we use SKlearn, Anova, RandomClassifier for feature selection. 
After that I created logistic regression model.
At the end I applied ML models and ANN for model selection.
